# Indigenous-Language-Classification
Identifying a language is still a very important topic in natural language processing. 
This is especially true for languages with oral tradition, an aspect that usually lead to a small amount of texts 
available.

In that context, lack of documentation and study of such endangered indigenous dialects lead to a high risk of extinction 
of such languages by the end of this century.

Therefore, this paper is the first to propose a benchmark evaluation between
different models aiming to categorise 26 Brazilian indigenous languages with oral tradition automatically. 
Besides that, it is proposed a simpler character n-gram feature extraction for language classification.
